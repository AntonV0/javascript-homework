# JavaScript Homework
## Project #59 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This short project is centered around GitHub commands used for projects that require teamwork. The aim was to clone a remote repository, add a comment to the code, and then push a new branch of the cloned repository to the remote.
## What I Learned
  - Cloning remote repositories with git clone "original-repository" "clone-name"
  - Fetching work from the remote into the local copy with git fetch
  - Merging origin/master into the local branch with git merge origin/master
  - Pushing the local branch to the origin remote with git push origin "branch-name"
